#About

I created this simple project to work on integrating Express.js, AngularJS, and MongoDB. Previously, I had used Express.js without AngularJS and AngularJS in a Sails.js framework. Therefore, I created a simple project to practice combining Express.js with AngularJS, using Mongoose as my ORM.
